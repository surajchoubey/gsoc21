Before going through this, it is strongly recommended you have knowledge of Monte Carlo Integration process. You can study it from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration#Overview). Also it is recommended that you have gone through the previous post on [Simple MC Integration](/simple-mc-integration/).

## What is Lovasz Vempala Integration?
Lovasz Vempala Integration algorithm is used from this [research paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/acg/www/www/papers/integration.pdf). This integration algorithm can be used to integrate logconcave density functions particularly $$g(x)$$, which are expressed in the form of $$f(x) = e^{-g(x)}$$. The logconcave function $$f(x)$$ can be integrated over a polytope using [**Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434). The integration algorithm uses this algorithm to run the random walks used for sampling for the Monte Carlo integration process.

## Why this Integration Algorithm over the Simple Monte Carlo Integration?
Assuming the have the knowledge of Simple Monte Carlo Integration for integration of functions over $$n$$ dimensional polytopes, from the previous post on [Simple Monte Carlo Integration](/simple-mc-integration/).

In here, the problem arises, that integral answers deviate proportionately as we increase the dimensions and causes more and more estimation errors. The numbers of samples points to be considered for Monte Carlo Integration can be decided by user on their whereas in Lovasz Vempala Integration the problem is solved by the algorithm itself, by choosing the number of sample points with respect to the number of dimensions. Ideally, more the number of random sample points taken into consideration from the subspace(in this case it is a polytope) it does help in mixing the random points(which are taken into account to perform the Monte Carlo Integration Algorithm) more uniformly and througout the subspace but cannot be trusted for expecting very small estimation error. Though it works well but still if the user prefers to go using trustable sampling technique with small estimation error Lovasz Vempala Integration algorithm has an edge over here.

## The Theory Behind Lovasz Vempala Integration Algorithm
The algorithm can be little tricky to explain but I am going to make it easy and simple to understand. The algorithm can be found on page 7 of this [research paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/acg/www/www/papers/integration.pdf). Now that we are aware of the caveats of Simple Monte Carlo Integration process, lets jump onto this.

Let $$f(x) = e^{-g(x)}$$ be desired logconcave function to integrate over a subspace(in this example it is a polytope). A few more stuff and some variables you need to know about:

  B = 2n + 2ln \left( \dfrac{1}{e}\right) + n\cdot ln\left(\dfrac{1}{\beta}\right)
\end{equation*}
$$

$$
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle m = \Bigl\lceil \sqrt{n} \cdot ln(B) \Bigr\rceil
  \end{equation*}
$$

  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle k = \Bigl\lceil \dfrac{512}{e^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot ln(B) \Bigr\rceil
  \end{equation*}
$$

$$
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle a_{i} = \dfrac{1}{B}\left(1 + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right)^{i}
  \end{equation*}
$$

$$
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle f_{i}(x) = f(x)^{a_{i}}

    \displaystyle f_{m}(x) = f(x)
  \end{equation*}

1. We run warmstart samples from a choosen point say $$x_{0}$$ for $$k$$ times to ensure proper mixing using uniform random walks mechanism around the $$n$$ dimensional subspace $$K$$ ($$n > 0$$). The point is chosen such than $$f(x_{0}) \ge \beta^{n} \cdot f(x_{max})$$, where $$x_{max}$$ is the global maxima of the function within the subspace $$K$$ choosen itself and $$\beta$$ is a parameter).

2. Let $$W_{0} = volume(K)$$ be the estimation of the volume of subspace $$K$$.

3. For $$i = 1,2,...,m$$, do the following: <br>
    * Run the samples $$k$$ times with target density proportional to $$f_{i-1}$$ and starting points $$ \displaystyle X_{i-1}^{1}, X_{i-1}^{2}, ... , X_{i-1}^{k} $$ to get independent random points $$ \displaystyle X_{i}^{1}, X_{i}^{2}, ... , X_{i}^{k} $$

    * Using these points we compute <br><br>
      $$
      \begin{equation*}â€Ž
          \displaystyle W_{i} = \dfrac{1}{k} {\sum}\limits_{j = 1}^{k} f(X_{i}^{j})^{a_{i} - a_{i-1}}
      \end{equation*}
      $$

4. Return $$W = W_{0} W_{1} ... W_{m}$$
<br><br>
W is the desired integral value for our logconcave function $$f(x)$$ over the desired subspace $$K$$. By multiplying $$W_{1} W_{2}... W_{n}$$ the telescopic series in the exponents gets canceled out. And we are left with the desired value of the the integral $$W$$.

## The Project
As discussed the theory above in this process, it involves to build an integration function ```lovasz_vempala_integrate()``` using Lovasz Vempala Integration algorithm. Regarding building the function we take in several parameters. So lets list them down, and explain each of them before proceeding to the next part:

### Structure of the integration function<br>
```
template
<
	typename EvaluationFunctor,
	typename GradientFunctor,
	typename Parameters,
	typename WalkType,
	typename Polytope,
	typename Point,
	typename NT
>
NT lovasz_vempala_integrate(EvaluationFunctor &g,
                            GradientFunctor &grad_g,
                            Parameters &params,
                            Polytope &P,
                            Point x0,
                            NT beta = 1.0,
                            volumetype voltype = SOB,
                            unsigned int walk_length = 10,
                            NT epsilon = 0.1)
```
<br>
* `EvaluationFunctor` is the type of function expressed in terms of $$g(x)$$` which is meant to be integrated in the form of $$f(x) = e^{-g(x)}$$ around the provided subspace which is a polytope in this case.

* `GradientFunctor` is a type of gradient function which returns the gradient of a the `EvaluationFunctor g` as discussed above to return <br><br>
$$
  \begin{equation*}
    \left[ \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{2}}, ... , \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}} \right]
  \end{equation*}
$$

  the term right above is the gradient for $$f(x)$$ which is $$\nabla f(x)$$. <br>Also, $$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$ represents partial differentiation of a function $$f$$ with respect to $$y$$.

* `Parameters` are the additional variables that let you decide more variables to customize your function and your gradient function. (Ideally you can look here in [oracle_functors.hpp](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/blob/develop/include/ode_solvers/oracle_functors.hpp) from [GeomScale/volume_approximation](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation) repository and have a close look o how gradient functor, evaluation functor and parameters are constructed under one `struct`)

* `Point` is a user-defined datatype to store n-dimensional points in the n-dimensional space. $$x_{0}$$ is a point chosen such that $$f(x_{0}) \ge \beta^{n} \cdot f(x_{max})$$ satisfies.

* `NT beta` is a parameter in integration to help decide other $$\beta$$-dependent parameters.

* `volumetype` is an `enum` used to specify the volume algorithm in this [directory](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/tree/develop/include/volume) from [GeomScale/volume_approximation](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation) to calculate the volume of the given subspace. Available options from `enum` ones are `CB`,`CG` and `SOB`. Namely, cooling balls, cooling gaussians and sequence of balls algorithm.

* `walk_length` is the walk length which is going to be used for length of the walks which is supposed to be used in running warmstart samples, volume calculation algorithms and HMC algorithm.

* `NT epsilon` i.e. $$e$$ is the permissible error which can be set by the user to increase accuracy for the volume algorithm. $$e$$ is also dependent on the $$\beta$$ dependent parameters too.

* `typename WalkType` is type of random walk which will be used to run hit-and-run sampling for the warmstart samples and ensure proper mixing. Available ones are BallWalk, CDHRWalk, RDHRWalk, BilliardWalk, AcceleratedBilliardWalk and so on.

### How this algorithm is applied to the project?
After supplying the above quantities and objects to the integration function, we get down to the main business.

1. We use an `OptimizationFunctor` which wraps the supplied `EvaluationFunctor` and `GradientFunctor` and samples from the `EvaluationFunctor` proportionally to the variance `alpha`(a variables as discussed above). OptimizationFunctor has its own parameters which helps us setup the variance accordingly

2. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Walk which is already implemented in [here](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/blob/develop/include/random_walks/hamiltonian_monte_carlo_walk.hpp) is used to sample from logconcave density functions.

3. From the supplied `WalkType`, $$k$$ warmstart samples are run to ensure that the HMC walks have got properly mixed and follow memoryless property to choose the starting point based on random decision.

4. Proceeding to the main part of the Lovasz Vempala Algorithm. A nested loops is run. In the outer loop, we keep running the loop until variance $$a_{i} $$ crosses 1. $$W_{i}$$ for $$i = 1,2,...,m$$ if calculated and multiplied subsequently to $$W_{0}$$ where we calculated the volume of the subspace.

5. For the inner loop HMC walks are executed inside the subspace which samples points properly. $$W_{i}$$ is calculated for $$g(x)$$ expressed as a logconcave function where $$g(x) \propto a_{i} - a_{i-1}$$ for $$k$$ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo walks with `walk_length` set from the function declaration itself. 

6. Return $$W = W_{0} W_{1} ... W_{m}$$.

## Testing 
Testing has been done using **Monte Carlo Integration** functions from the `torchquad`. You can find the tests on this [github repository](https://github.com/surajchoubey/torchquad-checks). You can go through the `README.md` and it will explain all the required information. 

## Usage
For testing out the `lovasz_vempala_integrate()` it is recommended that you have look over [oracle_functors.hpp](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/blob/develop/include/ode_solvers/oracle_functors.hpp)  in [GeomScale/volume_approximation](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation) github repository to get basic understanding of how EvaluationFunctor and GradientFunctor are implemented. 

### Example Code
As explained above about the variables they are passed as they satisfy the conditions of the algorithm. For a more detailed look on the code you can visit to `test/lv_mc_integration.cpp`

```ruby


# 1. g is the EvaluationFunctor
# 2. grad_g is the GradientFunctor
# 3. HP is the polytope passed
# 4. AcceleratedBilliardWalk is the walktype passed for running warmstart samples
# 5. HPOLYTOPE specifies notation of the polytope( also other examples 
#    like VPOLYTOPE not tested particularly on it yet)
# 6. Point is a user defined datatype to represent n-dimensional points in n-dimensional space
# 7. NT is the number type(it can be float/double)
# 8. beta is an integration parameters whose value can be between (0,1]
# 8. x0 is the point that is the initial point chosen to run the 
#    warmstart samples so it properly mixes before running the HMC walks
#    It should be chosen such that it satisfies f(x0) >= beta ^ n * max(f)
