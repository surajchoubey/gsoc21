So I was lying in bed after having a exhausting day of end-semester exams and watching [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/), waiting for 23:30 IST (18:00 UTC) for my acceptance letter. I was feeling a strong chance of 40-60 of getting selected after analyzing my efforts I had invested during the Pre-GSoC time. My heart was pounding fast and I slowly became less interested in the sitcom and suddenly my phone pops up a an email notification. Holy cow! **I got accepted into Google Summer of Code '21 for real**.

I would love to express my gratitude towards my mentors:
* [Marios Papachristou](https://papachristoumarios.github.io/)
* [Apostolos Chalkis](https://tolischal.github.io/)
* [Vissarion Fisikopoulos](https://vissarion.github.io/)
* [Elias Tsigaridas](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Elias.Tsigaridas/)

for giving me this opportunity and considering me to be worthy of this project. Also, a huge thanks to Google Summer of Code team for conducting this wonderful program.
